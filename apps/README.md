# Independent desktop applications

**[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)**

Every direct child is a standalone Qt Quick application and a separate
process. Applications may import `shared/`, communicate with `services/`
through documented contracts, and must never import `shell/desktop/`.

The application workspace is configured from the repository root. Four build
options and matching CMake presets keep the new applications independently
manageable:

| Application | Target | Configure preset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Calendar | `kos-calendar` | `calendar-dev` |
| Todo | `kos-todo` | `todo-dev` |
| Weather | `kos-weather` | `weather-dev` |
| Music | `kos-music` | `music-dev` |

Use `apps-dev` to build all four. Each application owns its executable, QML
module, desktop entry, tests, and bilingual documentation. `apps/common/` is a
small application runtime rather than a feature layer; applications do not
import one another. The Weather preset additionally builds and installs its Go
data service, which the application starts on demand.

## Development: QML hot reload

Every application can load its QML from a source tree and hot reload it, so QML
edits need neither a rebuild nor a restart:

```bash
.build/music-dev/apps/music/kos-music --watch-qml apps/music/qml
# or skip the argument via the environment
KOS_APP_QML_DIR=apps/music/qml .build/music-dev/apps/music/kos-music
```

The path names the directory holding `Main.qml` (or the entry file itself).
`*.qml`/`*.mjs` files in the tree are watched and the window is rebuilt after a
300 ms debounce; the new code is fully compiled on a throwaway engine first
(including referenced siblings), and text that does not compile reports its
errors and keeps the current window. Controllers created in C++ and injected
into QML through initial properties (such as music's `music`) survive a reload:
playback, the queue, the database connection, and the MPRIS registration keep
running. QML-owned state (the current page, open dialogs) resets.
`shared/qml` (Kos.Ui) is compiled into the binary and still needs a rebuild.

A watch run is an isolated development instance: it never displaces the
single-instance activation of the running application. C++ edits still need a
rebuild; only QML/JS edits go through hot reload.

For a persistent per-user installation on Plasma, run:

```sh
./tools/install-apps.sh
```

`install-apps.sh` builds all four applications, rather than only the app you
intend to open. In addition to the base requirements in the repository README,
install these Arch build dependencies first:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed kcalendarcore gstreamer gst-plugins-base-libs taglib
```

`kcalendarcore` is required by Calendar and Todo; GStreamer and TagLib are
required by Music. Go is required by Weather and is already part of the core
KOS build requirements. Runtime GStreamer codec/plugin packages are separate:
install the ones needed for the audio formats and output backends you use.
Building a single app with its corresponding CMake preset needs only that
app's direct dependencies.

This performs a Release build and test pass, installs the binaries under
`~/.local`, registers desktop entries, hicolor icons and AppStream metadata,
enables the core `kos-data.service`, registers the D-Bus-activated PIM service,
and refreshes Plasma's application cache. The desktop entries contain absolute executable paths, so
the applications remain available after login without a source-tree build.
Re-run the same command to perform an in-place upgrade.

Each application exposes the same appearance settings with the platform Preferences shortcut
(typically `Ctrl+,`): system,
light or dark appearance; automatic, glass or solid material; opacity; accent
colour; reduced transparency; and reduced motion. Preferences use one shared
store and propagate to other running KOS applications. On KDE Plasma the app
runtime uses `KWindowEffects` for native blur and background contrast when the
compositor advertises them, with a readable solid fallback everywhere else.

`settings` predates this workspace and remains on its existing build path
until its source-path-dependent QML loader is migrated separately.
